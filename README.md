Perfect ✅
Here’s the cleaned-up Hackathon README.md where all folder structures and templates are formatted using pre-formatted code blocks so they render properly:

## 📂 Folder Structure  

hackathon/
│
├── submissions/
│   ├── README.md   ← Team details (this file, updated by you)
│   ├── code/       ← All source code files
│   ├── docs/       ← Documentation, reports, presentations
│   └── demo/       ← Screenshots, videos, demo links
│
└── guidelines/
└── README.md   ← Hackathon rules and instructions

---

## 📝 Instructions  

1. Inside the `submissions/` folder, fill in your **team details** in the `README.md`.  
2. Place your files in the correct subfolders:  
   - `code/` → All source code files  
   - `docs/` → Documentation, reports, presentations  
   - `demo/` → Screenshots, demo videos, or links  
3. Ensure your `README.md` has all team information filled correctly.  

---

## ✅ Example  

hackathon/
│
├── submissions/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── code/
│   │   └── main.py
│   ├── docs/
│   │   └── project-report.pdf
│   └── demo/
│       └── demo-video.mp4
│
└── guidelines/
└── README.md



👉 Now your folder structure will always render properly as a block, not inline.

Do you want me to also create a separate submissions/README.md template (just for team details), so each team only edits that file and keeps the main README clean?
